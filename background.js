/**
 * background.js - orchestrates the automated search loop across named
 * "projects" (each project = one company list + its own results, kept
 * fully separate from other projects).
 *
 * This is the AI-answer-focused sibling of the other "Company Website
 * Finder" extension, and it searches in BATCHES, not one company per
 * search: each worker claims up to `project.batchSize` pending companies
 * at once and asks about all of them in a single Google search query -
 * see buildBatchPrompt() below (and buildSearchUrl() on why that query
 * must NOT ask for &udm=50 any more). That's a direct,
 * deliberate trade-off for throughput: batchSize=5 means 5x fewer Google
 * searches for the same list, which means faster completion AND lower
 * CAPTCHA/block risk (fewer requests from this IP), at the cost of a
 * batched answer being slightly less reliable per-company than asking
 * about just one. That reliability gap is closed, not ignored: any
 * company a batch answer doesn't clearly resolve is never silently lost -
 * see "forceSingle" below.
 *
 * SOLO SEARCHES ARE DISABLED. Companies a batch answer doesn't cover used
 * to be pulled out and searched one at a time ("forceSingle"). That was
 * correct but ruinously slow - one missing line in a five-company answer
 * cost five extra searches - so throughput now wins: content.js reloads a
 * completely empty search once, then records whatever is still unresolved
 * as not_found and the run moves on to the next batch. Those rows stay
 * recoverable through the popup's "Retry not-found rows". The forceSingle
 * flag is no longer set, and any left over from an older run is ignored
 * when claiming (see processNext).
 *
 * Only ONE project can be actively running at a time, but a running
 * project can use several concurrent tabs ("workers", configurable per
 * project, 1 to MAX_CONCURRENCY - independent of batchSize: concurrency is
 * how many tabs run in parallel, batchSize is how many companies each tab
 * asks about per search). Running two DIFFERENT projects through the
 * engine at once is still rejected - that's what would actually corrupt
 * which result belongs to which company. Multiple workers on the SAME
 * project's queue is safe because every read-modify-write of the shared
 * engine state goes through mutateEngine(), which serializes them (see
 * "Concurrency safety" below) - two workers finishing at nearly the same
 * instant can't claim the same item or clobber each other's write.
 *
 * Storage layout (chrome.storage.local):
 *   aimProjectIndex        -> { [id]: { name, createdAt, total, counts } }
 *                              lightweight, always small - safe to read on
 *                              every poll for the project list.
 *   aimProject_<id>         -> full project record (including its queue) -
 *                              read/written per-project, not all at once,
 *                              so one large project doesn't make every
 *                              write touch every other project's data too.
 *   aimEngine               -> the single shared run-state: which project
 *                              is active, running/paused, and one entry
 *                              per worker (its tab + claimed item IDs).
 *
 * IMPORTANT / non-negotiable behaviour:
 *   On a CAPTCHA/block page, this PAUSES the whole run and brings that tab
 *   to the front so you can solve it by hand - it never attempts to solve,
 *   click through, or otherwise bypass one itself. See content.js's
 *   isBlockedPage() / waitForCaptchaSolved(). Once solved, the search that
 *   was interrupted continues and the run resumes automatically - no
 *   button to click. If nobody solves it within CAPTCHA_WATCHDOG_MS, the
 *   whole in-flight batch is marked "blocked" for manual review and the
 *   run stays paused (Resume is a manual click at that point). More
 *   concurrent tabs means more simultaneous traffic from one IP, which
 *   raises block risk - that trade-off is the user's to make via the
 *   per-project setting, not silently maximized here.
